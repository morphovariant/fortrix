## Clinical Project Forecasting : Integrated Participation, Supply, and Expense Planning

# About the Project

Like most project managers, Clinical Project Managers (CPMs) keep project teams on target, manage timelines, monitor progress, communicate status, and track spending. At the same time, clinical trials present unique challenges and needs. CPMs must operate at the intersection of grievous illness; regulated, collaborative activity with global networks of field staff and partners; large, highly-scrutinized budgets; and 5-10 year timelines. While different companies divvy responsibilities differently, the CPM team I support is specifically responsible for forecasting study participation (including sites and subjects), estimating drug need (provided monthly to the supply team), and compiling the budget (reconciled quarterly and shared with the finance team).

While there are many tools on the market to help CPMs, none handle all three of these complex, highly interdependent artifacts. So we’ve been relying on Excel. Interestingly, the Excel ‘template’ we have been using (fairly successfully) was developed by an individual who took the idea with him to other companies where similar needs had no better solution available. Over time, the complexity of the template has rendered it difficult to manage, modify for new study designs, and train new staff. Additionally, separate, slightly different Excel files for each study precludes automated reporting across studies and requires manual integration of actuals for the purpose of reforecasting. As the company continues to experience success and growth, the need for a more stable, scalable solution becomes more pressing.

In addition to managing the critical links between trial participation, supply and cost, our goals included: 
- The centralization of forecast data for cross-study reporting; 
- The automated integration of actuals (both enrollment and expenses) to support the fine-tuning of ongoing studies; 
- The ability to leverage historical study data in the modeling of new studies
- The functionality to support scenario modeling (potential new studies and potential changes to existing studies) 

Fortrix achieves this with a multi-dimensional model, centralized calculations, and integrated reporting. Dimensions such as Cohort and Product enable us to forecast enrollment and supply with more detail and less effort; while the Program and Version dimensions support scenario modeling for new and existing studies, respectively. Calculations are available in both real-time (similar to Excel formulas which respond immediately to given inputs) and via procedure (which ensures consistency while maintaining performance). Integrated reporting means that Supply and Finance can now get their data in a form that serves their needs better and from one source (instead of the dozens of current Excel files). Additionally, Clinical status reports will no longer require manual curation.
