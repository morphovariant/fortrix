## Clinical Project Forecasting : Integrated Participation, Supply, and Expense Planning

### About Fortrix

Like most project managers, Clinical Project Managers (CPMs) keep project teams on target, manage timelines, monitor progress, communicate status, and track spending. At the same time, clinical trials present unique challenges and needs. CPMs must operate at the intersection of grievous illness; regulated, collaborative activity with global networks of field staff and partners; large, highly-scrutinized budgets; and 5-10 year timelines. While different companies divvy responsibilities differently, the CPM team I support is specifically responsible for forecasting study participation (including sites and subjects), estimating drug need (provided monthly to the supply team), and compiling the budget (reconciled quarterly and shared with the finance team).

While there are many tools on the market to help CPMs, none handle all three of these complex, highly interdependent artifacts. So we’ve been relying on Excel. (Interestingly, the Excel ‘template’ we have been using (fairly successfully) was developed by an individual who took the idea with him to other companies where similar needs had no better solution available.) Over time, the complexity of the Excel template has rendered it difficult to manage, modify for new study designs, and train new staff. Additionally, separate, slightly different Excel files for each study precludes automated reporting across studies and requires manual integration of actuals for the purpose of reforecasting. As the company continues to experience success and growth, the need for a more stable, scalable solution becomes more pressing.

In addition to managing the critical links between trial participation, supply and cost, our goals included: 
- The centralization of forecast data for cross-study reporting; 
- The automated integration of actuals (both enrollment and expenses) to support the fine-tuning of ongoing studies; 
- The ability to leverage historical study data in the modeling of new studies
- The functionality to support scenario modeling (potential new studies and potential changes to existing studies) 

Fortrix achieves this with a multi-dimensional model, centralized calculations, and integrated reporting. Dimensions such as Cohort and Product enable us to forecast enrollment and supply with more detail and less effort; while the Program and Version dimensions support scenario modeling for new and existing studies, respectively. Calculations are available in both real-time (similar to Excel formulas which respond immediately to given inputs) and via procedure (which ensures consistency while maintaining performance). Integrated reporting means that Supply and Finance can now get their data in a form that serves their needs better and from one source (instead of the dozens of current Excel files). Additionally, Clinical status reports will no longer require manual curation.

### Timeline Management

With the Timeline template, CPMs indicate which time dimension members (i.e. months) belong to specific tasks. This results in dynamic groups of time dimension members which control the display of time on subsequent templates, such as Enrollment which displays FSA-FPI (First Site Active to First Patient In) and FPI-LPI (First Patient In to Last Patient In).

### Enrollment Forecasting

The Enrollment template helps CPMs to forecast the activation of clinical Sites (by Country) and the enrollment of clinical Subjects (by Country and Cohort - a Cohort is a group of Subjects on the same Treatment plan). The blue rows are informational to help CPMs estimate more accurately. In this case, Cumulative Sites multiplied by the Enrollment Rate results in Subjects (by ER) which are accumulated in the Cumulative Subjects row. CPMs can tweak these numbers until they look right and then populate them into the Subject row. Almost every calculation to follow will be based on Sites and/or Subjects.

### Treatment Planning

On the Treatment Planning template, CPMs input the variables which describe the Treatment for each Cohort. A separate procedure then combines these inputs with the Enrollment forecast and calculates: 
- How many Cycles to expect for the Subjects in different Cohorts; 
- How many Vials are needed of each Drug to treat those Subjects; 
- How many Vials are needed to Seed the Sites activated in each country. 
These monthly estimates are displayed below the Treatment plan for review.

(A Cycle is essentially a visit; participants are treated on a schedule comprised of repeated Cycles; in a Cycle, Subjects undergo one or more Treatments and one or more medical Tests to monitor efficacy and tolerance. Along with Sites and Subjects, Cycles are essential to subsequent Budget estimations.)

### Budgeting Central Labs

This Central Lab Detail Template enables CPMs to input estimates covering the life of the contract; these amounts are then spread in various ways (e.g. along Cycle or Enrollment curves) to better estimate monthly expenses. The Test portion also gives us more consistency and transparency in managing the samples that result from the Tests (e.g. biopsies). Sometimes Test results are processed in real-time, but often we group them into batches and the Central Lab Summary Template helps CPMs to explore various batching schedules.
